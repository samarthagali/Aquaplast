# AQUAPLAST

This repository contains the implementation of the YOLOv8 object detection model pipeline. YOLOv8 is an upgraded version of the popular YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, known for its real-time detection capabilities.
This prototype harnesses spatiotemporal data to create river surroundings heatmaps and enables environment prediction through time series analysis. The fusion of space and time offers a comprehensive understanding of dynamic patterns, empowering sustainable decision-making.
